body: Best Charcos ever!

Wow! Charos is definitely not the best wave venue in the World, but today it worked wonders! Overhead waves for 5 or 6 turns with multiple sections to hit the lip hard! And relatively safe so I could really go for it! While absolutely stacked on 4.7, could have easily sailed 4.2 :)

Many thanks to Noah for taking his camera out!
