body:

Family time on the Famara beach. Small and soft waves so I mostly went out to get wet a bit and do some exercise. 

But then when I came back to dry land my daughter was already in her wetsuit, eager to try the "tandem" bodyboard we bought in Decathlon the other day! So she did! Her first wave haha :)
