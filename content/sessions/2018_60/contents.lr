Even though I already sailed Jameos in the morning, I *really* wanted to try out the new 9cm shark-tooth type front fins that Russell shaped for me out of old Flikka fronts. 

They work brilliantly, especially in 4.2 weather! Can't wait to try them with 15cm K4 Scortchers that Mark is bringing in a few weeks!
