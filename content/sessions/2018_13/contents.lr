spot: Jameos del Agua

toys: Flikka Custom 85, Goya Fringe 5.0

body: Looked small and slow when we arrived. Was thinking of going home, but Mitja really wanted to go sail. The wind seemed strong enough for blasting around on 5.0 so why not, let's have another try on the new Frine 5.0. Turns out, it was another of those good days on Jameos! Just as we got in La Surfera started working, good size, with plenty of wind for getting back up in the lineup. Caught a gazillion waves in about an hour or so, then the wind picked up and started ruining the waves (was a bit onshore). Time to call it a day. And what a day it was!
