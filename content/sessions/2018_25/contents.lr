Sunrise session with Miƒç. We planned to go to La Garita, but it was too small so continued up north to Jameos. It was small and mellow, just how I like it the first time I go out on a new board: after breaking the finbox on his minimalibu, Tony was super nice and gave me another board, a wide epoxy 6.6".
