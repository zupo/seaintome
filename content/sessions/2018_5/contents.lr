body: I don't think I've ever seen so strong wind here. And so big waves. Only me and Tony were out, entire playground only for ourselves. Caught a few super nices ones, sprinkled some floaty jumps on top, and got back to the beach in about an hour, totally destroyed and with a huge smile.

Took a few shots as I was packing and a few locals showed up.
