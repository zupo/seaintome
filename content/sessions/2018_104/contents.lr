body: New favorite NE spot?

I saw Tim sailing El Cartel when I was driving up. I've heard so many good stories about this break that I decided to join him.

And boy did I enjoy it! This really is a fantastic wave. Especially in NE directions when Jameos is kind of onshore, this is perfect sideshore with a steep wall to carve against!

Do I have a new favorite sport for NE wind?
