body: Drove up North with Mič in search of beginner friendly surf. Luckily Baby Bay was working and those 4 surfers there were just getting out. We had the wave for ourselves for about an hour when the water got too low. Crystal clear water, steep takeoff and current to pull you out into lineup. Perfect :)
