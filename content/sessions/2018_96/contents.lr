body: Another Charcos with the freestyle

Similar wind to yesterday, with almost non-existent waves. Good practice! Oh and stomped a (wet) forward :)

The main two things I need to fix:
* do a rail-to-rail transition going from bottom to top turn, don't flatten the board if even for a split second
* get more over the back of the board in the cutback
