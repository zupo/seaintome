body: The windiest I've ever seen it here. Noone was in the water until later in the afternoon when it dropped -- to just perfect for 3.7! Massive waves in Costa Teguise, so I knew Matagorda was ON! And it was! Super nices waves were breaking next to the airport lights.

I love this spot so much, good waves and quite safe so I can really push and hit them late!
