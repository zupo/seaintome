body: Rented a bunch of beginner softboards and took friends to try surfing for the first time. Sadly, huge swell hit and we were on the beach just when hide tide was pushing in -- it was more survival battle for them than surfing. Anyone who has been in Famara in such conditions will know what I am talking about ;)
