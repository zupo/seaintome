body: The Pro's who are here for the ProAm race event saw my shots from yesterday and decided they want some waves too haha :) Conditions similar to yesterday, but the wave is so close to the rocks that it got crowded real bad. I got washed super hard but my kit somehow missed all the rocks and there was no damage when I swam to it -- caught it maybe 2 meters before it would get smashed onto another cluster of rocks. One of the other guys wasn't so lucky though, he broke *everything* when he got washed on not even that big of a wave :(. This spot is tricky ...
