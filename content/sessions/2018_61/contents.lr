Another great day at Los Charcos! Tried out the stiff quad fins in a close-together cluster: board loosened up! And I had a ton of energy, sailed bigger sail then other people (normally I choose smaller sails) and really attacked the waves!

Sadly, Soloshot was miss-calibrated, so the only shot I have is on of blasting around :D
