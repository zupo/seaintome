It looked shit from the beach and another guy with a SUP also complained it looked shit. Way too much water. We should wait for 2 hours, but we both can't do that. Bah, at least I'll get wet.

But then it turns out as one of the best surfing sessions I had so far! I caught a ton of waves, all good size with many (tiny :) turns on them. Super stoked! Celebrated with mojitos haha :D
