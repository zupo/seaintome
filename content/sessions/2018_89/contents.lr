body: Big San Juan

Bobo came over for a visit from Fuerteventura so we went together with Tony to sail San Juan. It was quite big and light, and sadly a tad onshore. Was quite scary at times, and I juuuuust managed to sail back to shore when rain started and wind died of almost completely. Tactical :)
