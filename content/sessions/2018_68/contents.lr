body:

Two hours waiting at Jameos, but it didn't happen. Too big waves, too onshore and light wind.

So went out for a freestyle session in Costa. Planed out and it dropped. So I was left with practicing tacks :)

Funnily enough, just as I came back to the beach, the shore break picked up and allowed for good body-boarding fun!
